It's all about trial-and-error, much like training a pet! The goal for the RL agent is to maximize its cumulative reward over time. This process involves exploration (trying new things) as well as exploitation (using known strategies that work). A famous algorithm used in reinforcement learning is Q-learning. Would you be interested in understanding how it works or have any specific questions about RL?",
